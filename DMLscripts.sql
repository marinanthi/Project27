Let the potatoes cool for 5-10 minutes on the sheet pan. While the potatoes cool, make the dressing, by combining all the ingredients in a jar, blender, or bowl and shake/process/whisk until smooth.
Add the cooled sweet potatoes to a large bowl. Add the cooked lentils, bell pepper, spinach, and celery. Toss lightly. Drizzle the dressing over the top, and gently mix to coat the salad ingredients with the dressing.

Combine the bean mixture in a blender or food processor.  Salt to taste (I added another pinch for this recipe). Shred 4-5 cups of Monterey Jack cheese. This is enough cheese for three single layer batches. Add a dense, single layer of chips to a sheet pan. (You can line the sheetpan with foil or parchment paper if you want to make cleanup easier).
Drizzle some of the beans over the chips.  Add a layer of cheese to the chips.  Bake in the oven at 400F for 5-7 minutes or until all the cheese is melted.

If you are making Avocado Salsa Verde, start by rinsing four fresh tomatillos.  I usually cut out the stems too.  Roast the tomatillos in the oven at 400F until cooked through and they start to turn army green. Add the roasted tomatillos to a blender along with ½ onion, 1 garlic clove, 10-12 sprigs cilantro, and ½ of a jalapeno pepper.
